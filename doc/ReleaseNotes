Support
================================================================
If you have any problems you are welcome to contact us.
You will find the contact information on the web at
http://www.kvaser.com.


================================================================
Version info
================================================================

   * Tested under x86_64 SMP Ubuntu 12.04 x32/x64 (3.2.0-29-generic-pae/3.2.0-23-generic).
   * Tested under x86_64 SMP Ubuntu 14.04 x32/x64 (3.13.0-32-generic/3.13.0-32-generic).
   * Tested under x86_64 SMP Ubuntu 16.04 x32/x64 (4.4.0-generic/4.4.0-generic).
   * Compiled with gcc version 4.6.3, 4.7.3, 4.8.2, 4.8.4, 6.1.1 and 6.3.1.
   * Used glibc version 2.15, 2.17, 2.19 and 2.24.


================================================================
General information
================================================================
System requirements: Linux 2.6.26 or later.

================================================================
Known problems
================================================================
   * Firmware bug in old Leaf firmware will make the driver report
     the wrong bus parameters when queried. Update the Leaf firmware.

   * Virtual CAN driver will not behave as it perhaps should when
     it is "off bus".

   * Single channel PCIcanII may report two channels.

   * It is possible to continue "using" a driver while it is
     trying to shut down. Nothing useful will happen, but the driver
     can be blocked from unloading indefinitely.

   * While the driver implements auto response functionality for all
     hardware, the same is not true for auto tx. The latter is only
     available if there is firmware support in the device.
     (This is the same as under Windows.)


New Features and Fixed Problems in V5.20   (05-MAY-2017)
===========================================================================

* Not implemented functions now correctly returns canERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED
  (instead of canERR_NOMSG).

* New CANlib SDK libraries released in kvlibsdk.tar.gz:
  - kvadblib
  - kvamemolibxml
  - kvlclib
  - kvmlib

* Added new APIs (canlib):
  - kvFileGetCount
  - kvFileGetName
  - kvFileDelete
  - kvFileCopyToDevice
  - kvFileCopyFromDevice
  - kvScriptStart
  - kvScriptStop
  - kvScriptLoadFile
  - kvScriptUnload

* Added canCHANNELDATA_HW_STATUS and canCHANNELDATA_FEATURE_EAN for
  internal use.

* Fixed bug in USB udev rules, causing each rule to trigger twice when a new
  Kvaser USB device was plugged in/unplugged.

* Fixed build issue on ARM64 targets. (atomic_set_mask)

* Updated doc/faq.

* Corrected timeGetTime in linlib.


New Features and Fixed Problems in V5.19   (15-FEB-2017)
===========================================================================

* Fixed bug in canReadSyncSpecific where extended identifiers was not
  recognized.

* Removed dependency, so calling 'sudo make install' and 'sudo make load' will
  not rebuild drivers, canlib, linlib nor example code.

* File access modes for installed files have been reviewed.

* Added new APIs:
  - kvFlashLeds.
  - kvReadTimer and kvReadTimer64.
  - canUnloadLibrary. It uses non-portable initialization of mutex (works on
    Linux only).

* Fixed bug when reading customized channel names, causing oops.

* Corrected data exchange between user space and kernel space, for ioctl.

* Fixed problem in makefile when building on openSUSE with kernel older than
  v3.18.0.

* The linlib shared object is now compiled with -lcanlib to declare the
  dependency toward canlib.

* Change canBusOn and canBusOff behavior, to match Windows. It is required to
  call canBusOn (and canBusOff) for each handle, even though they share same
  physical channel. Could potentially be a breaking change.
  See Kvaser canlib documentation for details.


New Features and Fixed Problems in V5.18   (28-SEP-2016)
===========================================================================
* Fix for Leaf incompatibility issue with Leaf FW older than version 3.8.


New Features and Fixed Problems in V5.17   (15-SEP-2016)
===========================================================================
   * Added Single shot functionality.

   * Added dummy canRequestChipStatus for code portability. The function
     canRequestChipStatus is not needed in Linux, but in order to make code
     portable between Windows and Linux, a dummy function returning canOK has
     been added.

   * Added support for reading out customized channel names for mhydra, pciefd
     and leaf (currently it is only possible to set customized channel names
     from Windows).

   * Added canReadSpecific, canReadSpecificSkip and canReadSyncSpecific.

   * Added canRequestBusStatistics and canGetBusStatistics.

   * Added canIOCTL_RESET_OVERRUN_COUNT.

   * Added make target 'uninstall' which unloads all Kvaser modules and
     removes entire Kvaser installation.
     It is possible to uninstall each individual driver, but it is not
     recommended. The usb based drivers uses the common udev rules
     (10-kvaser.rules) file to load and unload modules which remains
     until one executes 'sudo make uninstall'.

   * Added make target 'load'  which does the same as target 'install' and
     then loads all PCI modules also after reboot.

   * Leaf and Eagle devices now also defaults to canDRIVER_NORMAL.

   * Improved handling of illegal input parameters.

   * All canlib example code is reviewed and updated.


New Features and Fixed Problems in V5.16   (22-MAY-2016)
===========================================================================
    * CAN FD support (interface mode) for:
        - Kvaser Memorator Pro 5xHS  (00778-9)
        - Kvaser USBcan Pro 5xHS     (00779-6)
        - Kvaser Leaf Pro HS v2      (00843-4)
        - Kvaser USBcan Pro 2xHS v2  (00752-9)

    * Replaced Windows types with stdint types.

    * Added support for canGetHandleData.

    * Added canCHANNELDATA_CHANNEL_CAP_MASK to read which capabilities are
      confirmed dynamically by device.

    * Implemented canIOCTL_TX_INTERVAL, canIOCTL_SET_BRLIMIT and
      canCHANNELDATA_MAX_BITRATE.

    * Removed obsolete USB hotplug support.

    * Fixed bug, where return value of canIOCTL_GET_RX_BUFFER_LEVEL was affected
      by transmit buffer length.


New Features and Fixed Problems in V5.15   (07-MAR-2016)
===========================================================================
   * No changes, this is a companion release to the Windows version.


New Features and Fixed Problems in V5.14   (01-MAR-2016)
===========================================================================
   * A bug regarding maximum number of channels for a kernel module (MAX_CHANNELS)
     has been fixed for all drivers.

   * Timestamps are now stored as 64-bit values instead of 32-bit values to
     match canReadTimer().


New Features and Fixed Problems in V5.13   (15-DEC-2015)
===========================================================================
   * Updated pciefd driver to work without DMA (option USE_DMA in
     pciefd_config.h). Note, however, that this is an unupported (and
     consequently untested) feature that may break in the future.

New Features and Fixed Problems in V5.12   (21-SEP-2015)
===========================================================================
   * Sampling points of default CAN bitrates are now 75% instead of 62.5%.

   * Added tentative support (USB CAN communication only) for KVASER USBcan
     Light 4xHS, Leaf Pro HS v2, KVASER USBcan Pro 2xHS v2, KVASER Memorator
     2xHS v2, Memorator Pro 2xHS v2.

   * Improved support for CAN-FD for PCIEcan 4xHS.

   * Kvaser device drivers now all use a common driver (kvcommon) that is
     loaded seprarately.

   * Updated register names and definitions in PCIEcan driver to comply with
     the names used in the ISO standard for CAN-FD.

   * Kvaser PCIEcan 4xHS requires firmware 2.0.1 or higher.

New Features and Fixed Problems in V5.11   (21-MAY-2015)
===========================================================================
   * Blacklisting SocketCAN kvaser_usb driver when installing leaf and usbcanII
     drivers.

   * Implemented canOPEN_CAN_FD_NONISO flag to open a channel in non-ISO canFD mode.
     Added canCHANNEL_CAP_CAN_FD_NONISO capability for devices that can be opened
     in non-ISO canFD mode.


New Features and Fixed Problems in V5.10   (Internal release)
===========================================================================
   * Support for Kvaser PCIEcan 4xHS.

   * Tentative support for CAN-FD.


New Features and Fixed Problems in V5.9   (17-MAR-2015)
